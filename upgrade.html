      <h2>What happened?</h2>
      <p>The planned upgrade of the BCHA network has successfully been completed. The first post-upgrade block is block number <a href="https://explorer.bitcoinabc.org/block-height/686621">686621</a>.</p>
      <h2>I forgot to upgrade, what should I do?</h2>
      <p>If you forgot to upgrade, your node may have marked the upgraded chain as invalid. In order to fix this problem, simply upgrade to Bitcoin ABC version 0.23.4 or greater, available at our <a href="/releases">Releases page</a>.</p>
      <h2>What features were included in the Network Upgrade?</h2>
      <p>The May 15th 2021 upgrade did not include any new protocol features. However, because of the automatic replay protection that is part of the 6-month upgrade cadence, it is necessary for all full node operators to upgrade to 0.23.x.</p>
      <h2>Do I need to upgrade my wallet?</h2>
      <p>The network upgrade only affects full-nodes. This means that other BCHA software, including wallets such as <a href="/electrum">Electrum ABC</a> are not affected by the network upgrade.
