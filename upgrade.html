      <h2>What happened?</h2>
      <p>The planned upgrade of the eCash network has successfully been completed. The first post-upgrade block is block number <a href="https://explorer.bitcoinabc.org/block-height/713661">713661</a>.</p>
      <h2>Who needs to upgrade?</h2>
      <p>All operators of a Bitcoin ABC full node must upgrade to the latest major version (0.24.x). This is available at our <a href="/releases"> Releases</a> page.</p>
      <h2>What features were included in the Network Upgrade?</h2>
      <p>The November 15th 2021 upgrade did not include any new protocol features. However, because of the automatic replay protection that is part of the 6-month upgrade cadence, it is necessary for all full node operators to upgrade to 0.24.x.</p>
    <p><b>Note:</b> Version 0.24 has the "ecash" option ON by default.
      If you are already setting "ecash=1" in the node configuration, then nothing will change, 
      but it is a good idea to double check this setup when you upgrade the node version.</p>
      <h2>Do I need to upgrade my wallet?</h2>
      <p>The network upgrade only affects full-nodes. This means that other eCash software, including wallets such as <a href="/electrum">Electrum ABC</a> are not affected by the network upgrade.
