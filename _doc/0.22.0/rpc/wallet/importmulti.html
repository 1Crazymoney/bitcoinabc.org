importmulti "requests" ( "options" )

Import addresses/scripts (with private or public keys, redeem script (P2SH)), rescanning all addresses in one-shot-only (rescan can be disabled via options). Requires a new wallet backup.

Arguments:
1. requests                                                         (json array, required) Data to be imported
     [
       {                                                            (json object)
         "desc": "str",                                             (string) Descriptor to import. If using descriptor, do not also provide address/scriptPubKey, scripts, or pubkeys
         "scriptPubKey": "<script>" | { "address":"<address>" },    (string / json, required) Type of scriptPubKey (string for script, json for address). Should not be provided if using a descriptor
         "timestamp": timestamp | "now",                            (integer / string, required) Creation time of the key in seconds since epoch (Jan 1 1970 GMT),
                                                                    or the string "now" to substitute the current synced blockchain time. The timestamp of the oldest
                                                                    key will determine how far back blockchain rescans need to begin for missing wallet transactions.
                                                                    "now" can be specified to bypass scanning, for keys which are known to never have been used, and
                                                                    0 can be specified to scan the entire blockchain. Blocks up to 2 hours before the earliest key
                                                                    creation time of all keys being imported by the importmulti call will be scanned.
         "redeemscript": "str",                                     (string) Allowed only if the scriptPubKey is a P2SH address/scriptPubKey
         "pubkeys": [                                               (json array, optional, default=empty array) Array of strings giving pubkeys to import. They must occur in P2PKH scripts. They are not required when the private key is also provided (see the "keys" argument).
           "pubKey",                                                (string)
           ...
         ],
         "keys": [                                                  (json array, optional, default=empty array) Array of strings giving private keys to import. The corresponding public keys must occur in the output or redeemscript.
           "key",                                                   (string)
           ...
         ],
         "range": n or [n,n],                                       (numeric or array) If a ranged descriptor is used, this specifies the end or the range (in the form [begin,end]) to import
         "internal": bool,                                          (boolean, optional, default=false) Stating whether matching outputs should be treated as not incoming payments (also known as change)
         "watchonly": bool,                                         (boolean, optional, default=false) Stating whether matching outputs should be considered watched even when not all private keys are provided.
         "label": "str",                                            (string, optional, default='') Label to assign to the address, only allowed with internal=false
       },
       ...
     ]
2. options                                                          (json object, optional)
     {
       "rescan": bool,                                              (boolean, optional, default=true) Stating if should rescan the blockchain after all imports
     }

Result:

Response is an array with the same size as the input that has the execution result :
  [{"success": true}, {"success": true, "warnings": ["Ignoring irrelevant private key"]}, {"success": false, "error": {"code": -1, "message": "Internal Server Error"}}, ...]

Examples:
> bitcoin-cli importmulti '[{ "scriptPubKey": { "address": "<my address>" }, "timestamp":1455191478 }, { "scriptPubKey": { "address": "<my 2nd address>" }, "label": "example 2", "timestamp": 1455191480 }]'
> bitcoin-cli importmulti '[{ "scriptPubKey": { "address": "<my address>" }, "timestamp":1455191478 }]' '{ "rescan": false}'
