createpsbt [{"txid":"hex","vout":n,"sequence":n},...] [{"address":amount},{"data":"hex"},...] ( locktime )

Creates a transaction in the Partially Signed Transaction format.
Implements the Creator role.

Arguments:
1. inputs                      (json array, required) A json array of json objects
     [
       {                       (json object)
         "txid": "hex",        (string, required) The transaction id
         "vout": n,            (numeric, required) The output number
         "sequence": n,        (numeric, optional, default=depends on the value of the 'locktime' argument) The sequence number
       },
       ...
     ]
2. outputs                     (json array, required) a json array with outputs (key-value pairs).
                               For compatibility reasons, a dictionary, which holds the key-value pairs directly, is also
                               accepted as second parameter.
     [
       {                       (json object)
         "address": amount,    (numeric or string, required) A key-value pair. The key (string) is the bitcoin address, the value (float or string) is the amount in BCH
       },
       {                       (json object)
         "data": "hex",        (string, required) A key-value pair. The key must be "data", the value is hex-encoded data
       },
       ...
     ]
3. locktime                    (numeric, optional, default=0) Raw locktime. Non-0 value also locktime-activates inputs

Result:
  "psbt"        (string)  The resulting raw transaction (base64-encoded string)

Examples:
> bitcoin-cli createpsbt "[{\"txid\":\"myid\",\"vout\":0}]" "[{\"data\":\"00010203\"}]"
