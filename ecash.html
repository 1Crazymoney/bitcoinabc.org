      <h2>Here’s some of what’s happening:</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Bitcoin Cash ABC (BCHA) will rebrand to eCash (XEC)</li>
        <li>The primary unit will be bits (2 decimal places) instead of BCHA (8 decimal places, the legacy default used by both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash)</li>
        <ul>
          <li>1 BCHA = 1,000,000 XEC</li>
        </ul>
        <li>The address format will change the prefix from “bitcoincash:” to “ecash:”</li>
        <li>A new website will be launched at <a href="https://e.cash">e.cash</a></li>
        <li>And a special premiere at launch… Watch the countdown live at <a href="https://e.cash">e.cash</a> to catch it!</li>

      <h2>The eCash Mission</h2>
      <p>eCash is the natural continuation of the Bitcoin Cash project. Realizing the vision of the legendary Milton Friedman, eCash follows through on key promises such as the innovative Avalanche consensus layer while also introducing concepts never before seen in a Bitcoin project such as staking, fork-free network upgrades, and subchains.</p>
      <p>Look for the ticker symbol XEC on exchanges, wallets, or price charts, and take your first step towards true financial freedom.</p>
